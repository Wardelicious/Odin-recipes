<p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <B> Flour: </B> Raw all-purpose flour can cause foodborne illness, so you’ll have to heat-treat it before adding it to the dough. Find heat-treating instructions in Step 1 of the recipe. </li>
        <li> <B> Brown Sugar: </B> Brown sugar lends a sweet, warm flavor.  </li>
        <li> <B> Butter: </B> Beat the brown sugar with a stick of butter. </li>
        <li> <b> Vanilla: </b> Vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the edible cookie dough.  </li>
        <li> <B> Salt: </B> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make the edible cookie dough taste salty.  </li>
        <li> <B> Milk:</B> Milk adds moisture and helps create the perfect texture.  </li>
        <li> <B> Chocolate Chips: </B> Use a blend of semisweet and mini chocolate chips for the perfect cookie dough experience.  </li>
    </ul>
